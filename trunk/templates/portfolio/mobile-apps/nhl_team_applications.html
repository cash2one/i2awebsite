<p>Create <a href="/portfolio/mobile-apps">mobile applications</a> used by NHL teams to stay connected with their
fans. The apps were required to work across multiple platforms and provide near
real-time game updates, while simultaneously handling tens of thousands of
concurrent users.</p>

{% block solution %}
<p>Developing an application that will appeal to fans of specific NHL teams required
providing access to real-time data. We accomplished this by accessing NHL’s
HITS data feed to provide users with real-time box scores, shots on goal, and in-
game individual player data. While attending games, fans can use the application
to see parking maps and locate concession stands in the arena. There is also a
built-in e-commerce component for ticket sales. When the team is off the ice we
use automated feeds to keep fans updated on player stats, news, photo galleries,
videos, and more.</p>
<p>We understand that NHL teams have different requirements for their individual
apps. Keeping this in mind we made sure the app was scalable to support large
numbers of fans simultaneously. We built a customizable Content Management
System (CMS) on the back-end giving teams the ability to choose the type of
information provided by the app, to stream live video of the game, and to decide
how they will interact with fans. For teams that want to monetize the application
we included an integrated ad platform that can be turned on or off.</p>
<p>Each NHL team application is compatible with iPhone, Android, and BlackBerry
devices.</p>
