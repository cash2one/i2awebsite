<p>i2a developed a SaaS knowledge management system that is both scalable and customizable for each business and
individuals users. The product is designed to be used in many facets of a business including sales, training, partner
management, and transforming intellectual capital into actionable knowledge through information management.</p>
<p>We created a platform architecture that system administrators can easily manage
and integrate into existing user tools. Additionally, we created the product to
work with a companyâ€™s valuable data regardless of location and share it with
employees throughout an enterprise safely and securely, without interrupting
existing workflow procedures. The result is a knowledge management system
that helps businesses be more effective by giving their employees quick and
easy access to the information they need. As a result, employees' productivity
increased. The system has also improved communication and the coordination of
work.</p>
