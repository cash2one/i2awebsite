web-based application that interacts with AT&T’s web services.</p>

{% block solution %}
<p>In order for a company to effectively resell AT&T’s home services (TV, landline phone, and Internet) on the web,
we developed a web-based application that could access AT&T’s product offerings based on a customer’s home
address. The benefit is that the website could then populate AT&T product offerings including available specials
for the customers visiting the eCommerce website. We also provided the option for customers to customize their
selections and return more options dynamically generated by the internal AT&T system.</p>
<p>By integrating the <a href="/solutions-web">web application</a> seamlessly into AT&T’s centralized database the customer can also schedule
service calls once the services are selected and purchased. The product we designed complies with AT&T’s internal
requirements and we continue to maintain the site keeping it updated to meet AT&T’s requirements as they are
updated.</p>
