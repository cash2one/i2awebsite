    	<p>At i2a Solutions, we incorporate all the social media tools needed in mobile and web-based apps without compromising the finished product. We believe there is plenty of room for new and engaging social networking applications to emerge as leaders in the social space and have the expertise to make your vision a reality. We will also provide the tools needed to perform effective social media management.</p>
		<p> There is a difference between social networking and social media, but both are important when creating web-based applications. Social networking sites require a personal connection while social media sites offer a more public forum.
		Social networking is a tool people with common interests or goals use to meet online, to exchange ideas, and to share information. Social media is a content sharing platform that people and companies use for promotion and interacting with others.</p>
