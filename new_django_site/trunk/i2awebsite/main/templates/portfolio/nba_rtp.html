                    <p>We designed and built an iPad app and Content Management

                    System (CMS) for the NBAâ€™s Rookie Training Program (RTP). 

                    The app allows the league to train and test new players on 

                    employment practices, league policies and general best practices.</p>


                    <p>The app

                    also manages the schedule of events during the entire training program 

                    and enables communications, via secure messaging, between league</p>
