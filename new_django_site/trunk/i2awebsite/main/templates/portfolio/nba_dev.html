{% block content.solution %}
                    <p>We designed and built a multi-platform app for the NBAâ€™s Player 

                    Development Program (PD). The iPhone, iPad, Android Phone and 

                    Android Tablet apps allows the league and team personnel to assign 

                    training programs via web hosted content to the players and test their 

                    knowledge once each assignment is completed.</p>


                    <p>The app also manages

                    the schedule of each individual player and enables communications

                    between league officials, team personnel and players. This solution is 

                    now used exclusively by NBA as an essential tool in their educational and 

                    training programs on both a league-wide and franchise level.</p>
