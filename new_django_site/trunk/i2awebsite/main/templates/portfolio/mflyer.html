                    <p>Paper flyers cost a lot for a small business to design, print and ship to the customer. Moreover,

there is no easy way to track the return on paper flyers or measure their success in impressions, 

leads or sales. Moasis Global wanted to create a more targeted, measurable and paperless way 

for businesses to deliver relevant content, deals and advertising directly to their customers’ 

mobile phones using Moasis Global’s patented geo-location technology.</p>
