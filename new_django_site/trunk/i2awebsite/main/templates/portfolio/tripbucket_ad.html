{% block content.solution %}
                    <p>We built an easy to use self-service ad platform that allows businesses to target travel enthusiasts based on destinations and trip preferences. We created an easy-to-use system that developers of travel-based mobile and web-based app can use to register their apps for possible advertising opportunities. Advertisers utilize the system to send targeted ads to users of travel-related mobile apps or web-based apps. They can also set parameters for how much they want to spend on a campaign and use their own graphic or text-based banner ads.</p>


                    <p>In addition to specific travel parameters, advertisers can target ads to be delivered to users based on gender, age, and interest. To help accurately measure a campaignâ€™s performance, we included the ability to run reports using the included analytic tools. Agencies will appreciate that the system works well with third party tools such as DART reporting.</p>
