                    <p>The Bill Pay app is a downloadable smart phone app and integrated with a hosted server 

                    platform. Together, this solution allows a consumer to pay a bill by photographing a bill,

                    statement or invoice for scheduled payment. It allows consumers to leverage a variety

                    of payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, bank accounts, online accounts, 

                    wallets and prepaid alternatives, giving consumers ease-of-use and freedom of choice.</p>


                    <p>It leverages smart-phone-enabled “snap and capture” capabilities, including identification 

                    using a Driver’s License, and linking with bank accounts by snapping a picture of a check.</p>
