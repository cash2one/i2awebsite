                <div>
                    <p>To deliver targeted location-based ads to consumers on a cell phone or tablet, we created a system that provides advertisers (small businesses, agencies, and marketers) the ability to target a specific customer based on their location.<br><br>

                    We built an easy to use self-service platform that allows businesses to use their own graphic or text-based banner ads in a given campaign and then visually pinpoint where the ads would be delivered within specific grids in a city or region. To help accurately measure a campaignâ€™s performance, we provided the ability to run reports using the included analytic tools. Agencies will appreciate that the system works well with third party tools such as DART reporting.</p>

            <div class="column2">
                <div>
                    <p>The system goes beyond delivering location-specific ads, we also built-in the flexibility to integrate additional features into the ad such as the ability to place a call, see a location on a map, or even use a coupon. In addition to location parameters, users of the system can target consumers with specific interests. By implementing an auction-based bidding system companies can also decide how much they want to spend to achieve the reach they want.</p>
