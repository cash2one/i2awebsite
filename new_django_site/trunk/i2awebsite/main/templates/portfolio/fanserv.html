                    <p>We built an easy to use self-service ad platform that allows businesses to target sports enthusiasts based on team and league preferences. We created an easy- to-use system that mobile and web-based app developers can use to register their apps for possible advertising opportunities. Advertisers can use the system to send targeted ads to users of sports-related mobile apps or web-based apps. They can also set parameters for how much they want to spend on a campaign and use their own graphic or text-based banner ads..</p>

                    <p>In addition to league and team parameters, advertisers can target those with specific interests, age, gender and other options. To help accurately measure a campaignâ€™s performance, we included the ability to run reports using the included analytic tools. Agencies will appreciate that the system works well with third party tools such as DART reporting.</p>
