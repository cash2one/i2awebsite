                    <p>We combined our expertise in image analytics with existing facial recognition software to create a prototype of a facial comparison web application. The prototype used several different third-party facial recognition software packages to gather the required facial measurements. It then uses image analytics to compare the resulting data to find similar characteristics among a select group of faces. By using existing off-the-shelf software and creating algorithms to analyze collected data we were able to quickly deliver an affordable proof of concept to the client.</p>

                    <p>The application utilizes the following features to allow the system to integrate seamlessly into disparate databases of photos:<br><br>

                    Automated facial recognition<br>
                    Image cropping and alignment<br>
                    Image Registration to properly size the photos<br></p>
