                <div>
                    <p>The goal behind ImpressMe is to unify the fractured landscape that exists when shoppers 

attempt to research commonly compared products, like cars, prior to making a major purchasing 

decision. I2A Solutions was challenged to create an online platform where brands and consumers 

could converge to compare dozens of products side by side in an effort to win over the 

prospective buyer, as well as give the shopper a compete view of all brands, models, and product 

lines available to them.</p>

                    <p>ImpressMe is a video product comparison tool designed to let shoppers explore a full range 

of available products in an array of categories to compare products side by side. Shoppers can 

discover brands and models they may never have heard of before, search by features that are 

important to them, and find the product that best suits their needs. Through the online platform, 

informed buyers can watch and save product videos of their choice, access additional resources 

to help with their purchase decision, save product information in personalized collections, and 

assess the distinct features of each product in side-by-side comparisons.</p>
