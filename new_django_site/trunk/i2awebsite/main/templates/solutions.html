            <h2>Location Based Services</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The global market of location-based services (LBS) and Geolocation applications are enjoying strong growth. LBS services are designed to supply users of GPS- and Internet-enabled mobile devices with appropriate, timely and place-specific content. Geolocation is a forward-looking technology that provides the ability to track locations of users and follow their movements.<br><br>

                LBS services allow businesses to provide offers of locally relevant products and services when consumers are most susceptible to make purchases. Whether you want to create a website application that uses location based technology to enhance the user experience or build a location based mobile application we have the expertise to make it an engaging and successful product. We work with your company to get the product requirements and evaluate whether commercial or open source mapping solutions would best serve the product.<br><br>Using commercial mapping solutions such as Microsoft MapPoint, Bing Maps, and Google Maps we can create turnkey location based applications that work seamlessly with existing services. For a more customized location based application complete with rich layers and features we use open source mapping products such as OpenStreetMap, OpenLayers, GeoServer, and Mapnick. Additionally, we can enable geocoding into any of our location-based applications or integrate maps into existing websites and web-based applications. Using all the standardized API’s we can easily integrate popular social networking features such as Yelp, Facebook, FourSquare, and Twitter.

                If your company already has an application that needs to be monetized we can utilize our expertise with location detection technology to deliver location specific advertising to the users of the application.</p>

                <br><br>
                There is a difference between social networking and social media, but both are important when creating web-based applications. Social networking sites require a personal connection while social media sites offer a more public forum. Social networking is a tool people with common interests or goals use to meet online, to exchange ideas, and to share information. Social media is a content sharing platform that people and companies use for promotion and interacting with others.</p>
